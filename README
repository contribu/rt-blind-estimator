INTRODUCTION
This program allows the reverberation time of a venue to be determined
blindly, using a sample of music or speech that is recorded in the venue
C implementation of Paul Kendrick's Matlab algorithm:

Kendrick, Paul, et al. "Blind estimation of reverberation parameters for
non-diffuse rooms." Acta Acustica united with Acustica 93.5 (2007): 760-770.

C implementation by Kim Jones <K.Jones20@edu.salford.ac.uk>

PREREQUISITES
