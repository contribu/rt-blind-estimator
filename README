INTRODUCTION
This program allows the reverberation time of a venue to be determined
blindly, using a sample of music or speech that is recorded in the venue
C implementation of Paul Kendrick's Matlab algorithm:

Kendrick, Paul, et al. "Blind estimation of reverberation parameters for
non-diffuse rooms." Acta Acustica united with Acustica 93.5 (2007): 760-770.

C implementation by Kim Jones <K.Jones20@edu.salford.ac.uk>

The original source code for this project can be found in the src/ directory.


PREREQUISITES
The audio file should be a wav file and should be in mono signed 16-bit format
- please convert to this format before use.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
This program has been tested on x86_64 platform running the Ubuntu-based
Linux Mint 17.1. This will be extended to Windows platforms in the future.

You can then run the program from the same directory and this README by executing:
./blind_rt_est <Path to wav file>
