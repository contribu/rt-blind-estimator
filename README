Blind Estimation of Reverberation Time

PREREQUISITES
This program required that the libsndfile libraries be installed on the system 
running the program.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
This program has been tested on Debian systems. This will be extended to Windows
platforms in the future, once I actually get it working. This readme is really
just so that I remember what how to run it.
 
To run the program, execute the following:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/
gcc -o rt main.c ./kiss_fft130/kiss_fft.c -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lsndfile -L/usr/local/lib -lswresample -lavutil -lliquid -lnlopt -I./kiss_fft130 -lm -I/home/kim/SVDLIBC -L/home/kim/SVDLIBC -lsvd

You can then run the program by executing:
./rt

FUTURE PLANS
Make sure it works on Windows too.
Make a GUI.
Actually write a program implementing the algorithm......
