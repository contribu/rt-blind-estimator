INTRODUCTION
This program allows the reverberation time of a venue to be determined
blindly, using a sample of music or speech that is recorded in the venue
C implementation of Paul Kendrick's Matlab algorithm:

Kendrick, Paul, et al. "Blind estimation of reverberation parameters for
non-diffuse rooms." Acta Acustica united with Acustica 93.5 (2007): 760-770.

C implementation by Kim Jones <K.Jones20@edu.salford.ac.uk>

The original source code for this project can be found in the src/ directory.


PREREQUISITES
The audio file should be a wav file and should be in mono signed 16-bit format
- please convert to this format before use.


RUNNING THE PROGRAM
This program has been tested on x86_64 platform running the Ubuntu-based
Linux Mint 17.1. There is also a Windows version. This can be found on the
"windows_master" branch in the Github repository.

You can then run the program from the same directory as this README by executing:
./blind_rt_est <Path to wav file> [segment length]

The segment length is an optional command line parameter, expressed in minutes.
Each segment of the audio should contain 36 decays of at least -25 dB in order
to obtain accurate reverberation time estimates. The default is 3 minutes. If
you are unsure, ignore this parameter and keep the default value.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES & LICENSING INFORMATION
This software is licensed under the MIT Licence. In addition, the program uses
the following external libraries:

This software uses code of FFmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org) licensed under the
LGPLv2.1 and its source is located in the lib_src/ directory.

This software uses code of NLopt (http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt)
licensed under the LGPL and its source is located in the lib_src/ directory.

This software uses code of libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
licensed under the LGPL (>=v2.1) and its source is located in the
lib_src/ directory.

This software uses code of SVDLIBC (https://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/)
licensed under the BSD Licence and its source is located in the
lib_src/ directory.

This software uses code of liquid-dsp (http://liquidsdr.org/) licensed under the
MIT Licence and its source is located in the lib_src/ directory.

The source code for the external libraries was unmodified. The dynamic libraries
built using these versions of the source code can be found in the libs/ directory.


MISC INFORMATION
Since the binary is provided, there is no need for the user to comile this
code by themselves. However, in case the user is curious, this was the GCC
compile command used:

gcc -o blind_rt_est src/main.c -I./src -I/usr/include -L./libs -lsndfile -L/usr/local/lib -lswresample -lavutil -lliquid -lnlopt -lm -I./lib_src/SVDLIBC/ -lsvd -Wl,-rpath,./libs,--enable-new-dtags -fopenmp -floop-parallelize-all

Obviously, the locations of header files, etc, were dependent on the locations
on my system. However, if you install all of the tarballs in the lib_src
directory, it should not be difficult to compile from source. Since the
shared library files are provided, only the header files are needed from the
tarballs, so alternatively instead of installing, one could simply add -I
options to the command line for each required header file.
